Develop a simple Flutter mobile application that allows users to input and submit a medical bill. The application should have the following features:

1. A form to input the medical bill information, including the patient name and address, the hospital name, date of service, and bill amount.

2. A summary page that displays the input data, along with a button to return to the form and edit the information.

3. A home page that displays a list of the uploaded bills from the input form. The home page should have a button to open the form and add a new bill.
